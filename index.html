                <h1>OhDeer Games!</h1>

                <h2>OhDeer Games was first conceived in early 2012 when our lead.. person was unable to get anyone to match with him on Tinder. Or any other dating site_</h2>
                <p>Disgruntled, he decided to try to build an iPhone game he thought of during basic training. Realizing that programming was hard, he dug through the social mire of the internet and teamed up with Henry Hardy and Paul Treloar to get things rolling. He was better as a leader than a programmer anyway_</p>

                <p>With the trio complete, the boys started building fun things, and late night sessions of 'just trying one more thing' ended up with 1 completed game, 1 free to use cross platform game storage system, one client engagement analytics platform, and a patent on the previous systems_</p>

                <p>As it turned out, Henry was engaged to this really awesome front end named Jaqueline Wheeler, who we were lucky enough to have jump into the pack and take over as our lead front end. She makes the web do things people think it can't do_</p>

                <p>From the initial four, the team grew to incorporate a writer, a few back ends, this guy that hacked facebook twice, an android developer, a beagle, a unity developer, some front ends, and some designers. We have a team page to show everyone off_</p>

                            <p>AmBit_Score was the back end platform that we originally created to take care of the storage of high scores and rankings across our first release, DRoP. After we built it though, we realised what a great platform it was for other game developers to use for their own game backends, and have released it for free use to the public.

The #Bibs app was put together for the infamous #Bibs event held and hosted bi-anually by Just Digital People. The game was used to settle many disputes surrounding the the eternal question of "Who is more boss?"</p>
